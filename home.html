                Welcome to my website! My name is Jacob Robinson, and I'm an aspiring game developer at the University of Michigan. I'm the treasurer for WolverineSoft,
                the premier game development club at UofM. I also work as a game developer and designer at WolverineSoft Studio, which is our student-led game development studio.
                Check out the portfolio section of this website if you'd like to read a bit more about my projects with the studio, or if you'd like to play the games yourself! 
        </p>
        <p>
                I'm currently on the design team for WolverineSoft Studio's upcoming project, which is a case study of Heart Machine's <i>Hyper Light Drifter</i>. There isn't much I can
                share about this project yet, but I'm excited for you all to see what we've been working on. I think this project is shaping up to be one of my best yet!
        </p>
        <p>
                In the meantime though, check out the trailer for my most recent release with WolverineSoft Studio: <i>Subtension</i> when it releases on Steam on March 28th!
                Here is a trailer for the game:
