                        <i>Subtension</i> is a real-time strategy game made as a case study of <i>FTL:Faster Than Light</i> by Subset Games. It was developed in <b>Unity and C#</b> over the 2022 summer and fall semesters by WolverineSoft Studio:
                        the student-led game development organization at the University of Michigan. I worked with a team of around ~45 other programmers, artists, designers, producers, marketers, and sound designers throughout this project.
                        We utilize the <b>Agile design process</b>, along with tools such as <b>Jira, Confluence, and Bitbucket</b> to streamline our development process.
                </p>
                <p>
                        I worked on <i>Subtension</i> as a programmer in both the summer and fall semesters. In the summer <b>I wrote documentation in confluence</b> so that we could onboard the new programmers in the fall. 
                        We also created the combat prototype for the game, which can be downloaded on WolverineSoft's itch.io page below. During the prototyping I worked on most aspects of the game,
                        but my primary focus was creating the crew members, as well as implementing crew pathfinding. In the fall I fleshed out those systems and helped to apply a level of polish across the entire game.
                        Additionally, <i>Subtension</i> marked the start of WolverineSoft publishing our games on Steam!

                <p>
                        <i>Moles, Voles, and Trolls</i> is a tower-stacker game where you dig up building materials in the dig phase, and then stack them as high as you can to get a high score.
                        I made the project in <b>Unity</b> with 4 other people as a submission for WolverineSoft's 2021 Turkey Game Jam. The theme for the jam was, "Making a mountain out of a molehill".
                        My team and I ended up coming in 1st place with this project!
                </p>
                <p>
                        I was heavily involved from the get-go, as both one of the designers of the game and chief programmers.
                        I'm still very proud of this jam project, I think it turned out to be really polished and fun!

                <p>
                        <i>Overdeveloped</i> is a multiplayer-strategy game based off of the games <i>Overcooked</i> by Team17 and <i>Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes</i> by Steel Crate Games.
                        In the game, you play the role of a game developer who must create games based on the cryptic hints given from your contractors. 
                        You'll need to use the manual to decipher the hints, make the correct development decisions, and earn as much money as possible before your studio goes bankrupt!.
                </p>
                <p>
                        I worked on the project as both a designer and programmer. I created it in <b>Unity3D</b> with 3 other people as a submission for WolverineSoft's 2023 Shamrock Game Jam. The theme for the jam was, "From Scratch".
                        <i>Overdeveloped</i> ended up winning second place in the jam, as well as the award for best music, sfx, and audio!
