                <p>
                        <i>Curse of the Corsair</i> was my first time working as a game designer with WolverineSoft. I was assigned to be the game's enemy designer, so naturally I worked closely with the player designer to develop a satisfying combat loop.
                        Then I wrote design documentation for the three regular enemies, two level bosses, and the final boss that I had designed. The documentation is very thorough, it includes attacks(complete with timing, diagrams, and damage values),
                        behavior trees, use cases, and a written explanation of what strategy a player might employ to defeat the enemy. In addition to iterating on those designs, I utilized my <b>Unity</b> experience to bring implementation in line with my designs and fix bugs.
                        My prior experience as a programmer on <i>Subtension</i> also allowed me to communicate my needs effectively with the programming team, which kept my squad running like a well-oiled machine!
                </p>
                <p>
                        I'm very proud of my design for the final boss. I was told that I'd need to design a final boss for the game about a week after I had turned in my design for the boss of the second level, and by that point we knew that the art department wouldn't be able to make many more new assets.
                        I thought for a while about how to make a climactic and intimidating final boss without needing a whole bunch of new art. This was a really difficult problem, but I really like the solution I came up with! And I think that the behavior of the boss makes it super aggressive and fun to fight,
                        even for me, and I had to fight it a lot of times to tune the timing and damage values. You can see my documentation for the enemies in <i>Curse of the Corsair</i> below!

                        <i>Cellosseum</i> is a 2D action-roguelike game made as a case study of <i>Nova Drift</i> by Chimeric. It was developed in <b>Unity and C#</b> during the 2023 summer semester by WolverineSoft Studio:
                        the student-led game development organization at the University of Michigan. I worked with a team of around ~35 other designers, artists, programmers, producers, marketers, and sound designers throughout this project.

                <p>
                        <i>Cellosseum</i> was my first semester as the <b>design lead</b> for WolverineSoft Studio. As design lead, I hired my design team by conducting thorough interviews with many qualified candidates
                        and taught them how to write thorough design documentation and upload it to our <b>Confluence</b> page. I also led design meetings, performed design reviews, assigned tasks, and facilitated communications with the other departments, 
                        this allowed the project to maintain a cohesive creative vision and reasonable scope for all departments.

                <p>
                        I'm very proud of all of the work that WolverineSoft did on <i>Cellosseum</i>, I think that it wound up being one of our most complete and polished games ever! Throughout development, I learned how to direct the members of my team
                        without taking away their ownership of their corner of the project, which led to less creative overhead and allowed designers to be more imaginative.

                        I worked on <i>Subtension</i> as a programmer in both the summer and fall semesters. In the summer <b>I wrote documentation in confluence</b> so that we could onboard the new programmers in the fall. 
                        We also created the combat prototype for the game, which can be downloaded on WolverineSoft's itch.io page below. During the prototyping I worked on most aspects of the game,
                        but my primary focus was creating the crew members, as well as implementing crew pathfinding. In the fall I fleshed out those systems and helped to apply a level of polish across the entire game.
                        Additionally, <i>Subtension</i> marked the start of WolverineSoft publishing our games on Steam!

                <p>
                        During the development of <i>Subtension</i> I learned how to create basic pathfinding algorithms and NPC decision trees. This project was also where I learned how to maintain a balance between inheritance and
                        composition during development. This allowed me to create new crew types with their own unique special abilities much faster than I would have been able to do otherwise.

                <p>
                        The development of <i>Soul of the Forest</i> was filled with many unique challenges. It was our first time attempting an RPG and a narrative-focused game. In addition to doing all of the enemy design for the game, as <b>design lead</b> I had to navigate the complex relationship between narrative and game design.
                        Because we were doing so many things with this game that we had never attempted before, such as cutscenes, branching dialogue, and turn-based combat, the scope had ballooned well beyond what was possible for us to accomplish in a single semester.
                        This led us to add another semster to the dev time, so we could put out a polished game that we were all proud of. 
                </p>
                <p>
                        Unfortunately, the second semester of development on <i>Soul of the Forest</i> came with its own challenges. I was promoted to <b>project lead</b> during this time, which meant that I had to manage both my game design team and the leads of the other departments.
                        We also discovered during our playtests that people didn't think the combat system that I designed was very fun. So over a week, I had to redesign the combat system to focus on the more fun aspects of my initial design, without forcing our programmers to
                        rewrite massive portions of our codebase. What I came up with tested much better during our playtests, and it allowed each battle to feel more unique and exciting!
                </p>
                <p>
                        Since scope was such a large issue in our first semester, we naturally had to scale it back during the second. Part of my job as project lead was to check in with the other department leads and ensure that everything was still in scope. We managed to reduce the scope enough
                        in that second semester that the most important parts of the game were able to make it in with a very high level of polish. During the debugging and polishing phase of development I got in the engine to fix things like enemy behavior, mini-games, damage balancing, and the tutorials and UI.

                        This was the first project for EECS 494: Introduction to Game Development, a class at the University of Michigan that I took in the fall 2023 semester. My partner (Kaavya Ramachandhran) and I were tasked with recreating the first level of the classic NES game <i>Metroid</i>
                        in the <b>Unity</b> Engine. We also had to design and implement our own brand-new mechanic with a custom level into the game. Both the classic and new levels can be accessed from the main menu. 
                </p>
                <p>
                        I handled implementing all of the enemies, player movement, animations, and power-ups into the game. I also designed and programmed our custom mechanic. Kaavya added the camera tracking, sound effects, enemy and power-up placement, room transitions, 
                        and the level design for our custom level. 
                </p>
                <p>
                        Overall this project was a great way to refamiliarize myself with coding in <b>Unity and C#</b>, and creating the custom level taught me how to naturally introduce and expand upon concepts within a level.

                        This was the second project for EECS 494: Introduction to Game Development, a class at the University of Michigan that I took in the fall 2023 semester. I was tasked with creating a new game from scratch, I had to design and implement a "novel" mechanic.
                </p>
                <p>
                        The hardest part of this project was implementing the novel mechanic, which in my case was the ability to shrink down and climb walls. I tried to refactor some code from p1 for the wall climbing but adding player control made it a lot harder than I thought it would be.
                        The level design was also a hard challenge. I've done a lot of enemy design work in the past, but level design provides a new slate of challenges for me to overcome. I think that this has helped me become a better designer overall!

                        This was the final project for EECS 494: Introduction to Game Development, a class at the University of Michigan that I took in the fall 2023 semester. Similarly to <i>LightBerry</i>, I was tasked with creating a new game from scratch and had to design and implement a "novel" mechanic.
                        I created <i>Broadcast Day</i> in a team of 5 students over the course of 7 weeks. We developed the project in <b>Unity 3D</b> and made use of the <b>Atlassian Agile Development Suite</b>.
                </p>
                <p>
                        <i>Broadcast Day</i> is a 3D platformer where you awaken in an abandoned city as a robot with amnesia. You explore various locations around the city and talk to the other robots in the hopes of recovering your memories. There are 3 levels to explore, over 15 characters to meet, and a captivating story to uncover!
                        The spacious levels are brought to life through hand-drawn art and interactable characters.
                </p>
                <p>
                        I was primarily responsible for the camera and player movement, which was something that I had to continuously iterate on after each weekly playtest which has led to player movement that I think is pretty fun! I also did a lot of the art implementation, all of the collectible placement, and designed the ruins area of the game.
                        The game was initially inspired by other level-based 3D platformers such as <i>Sonic Adventure</i> and <i>Toree 3D</i>. As development progressed we switched to a more exploration-focused level design that directed the player towards talking to the many NPCs that populate the levels.

                        This is a game engine that I made over the course of a single semester in Winter 2024 as part of EECS 498: Game Engine Architecture at the University of Michigan.
                        Its architecture is heavily based off of Unity, and it is written in C++. The scripting language is Lua, I used Luabridge to connect the Lua scripts written by developers to the C++ core.
                        I linked the Box2D and SDL libraries to this engine to be used for physics and rendering respectively. This engine runs on Mac, Windows, and Linux.
                </p>
                <p>
                        I also wrote my own custom particle system for the engine, it's also based off of Unity's particle system and has a huge number of options to choose from so developers can get the exact effect they envisioned in their heads!

                        Technical Skills Used: C++, Lua, CMake, Box2D, Sol, Data-Oriented Design, Testing/Debugging 
                </p>

                <p>
                        Wolverine Engine is a custom 2D game engine I wrote with 2 of my peers during the summer of 2024. The engine is heavily based on Unity and its method of composition for game development.
                        I wrote the engine in <b>C++</b> using common libraries such as SDL2 for rendering and Box2D for physics.
                </p>
                <p>
                        One of my goals during development was to create a seamless build environment that works across multiple platforms so that developers could build for OSX and Windows without too much trouble.
                        To meet this goal I learned how to use <b>CMake</b> and link all of the external libraries that Wolverine Engine uses. Now building for OSX or Windows is as simple as running 2 commands in your terminal!
                </p>
                <p>
                        A game engine needs to store large amounts of the same class constantly within its storage (actors, components, scenes, etc...), so one of my professors suggested that we code portions of it in a
                        data-oriented way. Using <b>data-oriented design</b> in our game engine means that in large games there will be far fewer cache misses so the engine should be much smoother. After a few weeks of
                        learning how to code that way, I was able to create much more efficient actor and component systems for the engine.
                </p>
                <p>
                        Wolverine Engine was a project that presented me with challenges I had never had to face as a programmer before. Creating a build system that works across multiple platforms,
                        thinking about code in an all-new data-oriented way, and connecting <b>Lua</b> to C++ using Sol were only some of the tasks I faced. Creating a game engine meant I had to prepare for a near-infinite number of unique use cases, so optimization and complex test suites were more important than ever.
