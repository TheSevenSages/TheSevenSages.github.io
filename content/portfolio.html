                <h3 style="text-align: center;">Curse of the Corsair</h3>
                <p>
                        <i>Curse of the Corsair</i> is a 2D action-adventure game made as a case study of <i>Hyper Light Drifter</i> by Heart Machine. It was developed in <b>Unity and C#</b> during the 2023 winter semester by WolverineSoft Studio:
                        the student-led game development organization at the University of Michigan. I worked with a team of around ~35 other designers, artists, programmers, producers, marketers, and sound designers throughout this project.
                        We utilized the <b>Agile design process</b>, along with tools such as <b>Jira, Confluence, and Bitbucket</b> to streamline our development process.
                </p>
                <p>
                        <i>Curse of the Corsair</i> was my first time working as a game designer with WolverineSoft. I was assigned to be the game's enemy designer, so naturally I worked closely with the player designer to develop a satisfying combat loop.
                        Then I wrote design documentation for the three regular enemies, two level bosses, and the final boss that I had designed. The documentation is very thorough, it includes attacks(complete with timing, diagrams, and damage values),
                        behavior trees, use cases, and a written explanation of what strategy a player might employ to defeat the enemy. In addition to iterating on those designs, I utilized my <b>Unity</b> experience to bring implementation in line with my designs and fix bugs.
                        My prior experience as a programmer on <i>Subtension</i> also allowed me to communicate my needs effectively with the programming team, which kept my squad running like a well-oiled machine!
                </p>
                <p>
                        I'm very proud of my design for the final boss. I was told that I'd need to design a final boss for the game about a week after I had turned in my design for the boss of the second level, and by that point we knew that the art department wouldn't be able to make many more new assets.
                        I thought for a while about how to make a climactic and intimidating final boss without needing a whole bunch of new art. This was a really difficult problem, but I really like the solution I came up with! And I think that the behavior of the boss makes it super aggressive and fun to fight,
                        even for me, and I had to fight it a lot of times to tune the timing and damage values.
                </p>

                <p>
                        <i>Cellosseum</i> is a 2D action-roguelike game made as a case study of <i>Nova Drift</i> by Chimeric. It was developed in <b>Unity and C#</b> during the 2023 summer semester by WolverineSoft Studio:
                        the student-led game development organization at the University of Michigan. I worked with a team of around ~35 other designers, artists, programmers, producers, marketers, and sound designers throughout this project.

                </p>
                <p>
                        <i>Cellosseum</i> was my first semester as the <b>design lead</b> for WolverineSoft Studio. As design lead, I hired my design team by conducting thorough interviews with many qualified candidates
                        and taught them how to write thorough design documentation and upload it to our <b>Confluence</b> page. I also led design meetings, performed design reviews, assigned tasks, and facilitated communications with the other departments, 
                        this allowed the project to maintain a cohesive creative vision and reasonable scope for all departments.
                </p>
                <p>
                        I'm very proud of all of the work that WolverineSoft did on <i>Cellosseum</i>, I think that it wound up being one of our most complete and polished games ever! Throughout development, I learned how to direct the members of my team
                        without taking away their ownership of their corner of the project, which led to less creative overhead and allowed designers to be more imaginative.

                <p>
                        <i>Subtension</i> is a real-time strategy game made as a case study of <i>FTL:Faster Than Light</i> by Subset Games. It was developed in <b>Unity and C#</b> over the 2022 summer and fall semesters by WolverineSoft Studio:
                        the student-led game development organization at the University of Michigan. I worked with a team of around ~45 other programmers, artists, designers, producers, marketers, and sound designers throughout this project.
                        We utilized the <b>Agile design process</b>, along with tools such as <b>Jira, Confluence, and Bitbucket</b> to streamline our development process.
                </p>
                <p>
                        I worked on <i>Subtension</i> as a programmer in both the summer and fall semesters. In the summer <b>I wrote documentation in confluence</b> so that we could onboard the new programmers in the fall. 
                        We also created the combat prototype for the game, which can be downloaded on WolverineSoft's itch.io page below. During the prototyping I worked on most aspects of the game,
                        but my primary focus was creating the crew members, as well as implementing crew pathfinding. In the fall I fleshed out those systems and helped to apply a level of polish across the entire game.
                        Additionally, <i>Subtension</i> marked the start of WolverineSoft publishing our games on Steam!

                <p>
                        <i>Moles, Voles, and Trolls</i> is a tower-stacker game where you dig up building materials in the dig phase, and then stack them as high as you can to get a high score.
                        I made the project in <b>Unity</b> with 4 other people as a submission for WolverineSoft's 2021 Turkey Game Jam. The theme for the jam was, "Making a mountain out of a molehill".
                        My team and I ended up coming in 1st place with this project!
                </p>
                <p>
                        I was heavily involved from the get-go, as both one of the designers of the game and chief programmers.
                        I'm still very proud of this jam project, I think it turned out to be really polished and fun!

                <p>
                        <i>Overdeveloped</i> is a multiplayer-strategy game based off of the games <i>Overcooked</i> by Team17 and <i>Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes</i> by Steel Crate Games.
                        In the game, you play the role of a game developer who must create games based on the cryptic hints given from your contractors. 
                        You'll need to use the manual to decipher the hints, make the correct development decisions, and earn as much money as possible before your studio goes bankrupt!.
                </p>
                <p>
                        I worked on the project as both a designer and programmer. I created it in <b>Unity3D</b> with 3 other people as a submission for WolverineSoft's 2023 Shamrock Game Jam. The theme for the jam was, "From Scratch".
                        <i>Overdeveloped</i> ended up winning second place in the jam, as well as the award for best music, sfx, and audio!

                <p>
                        This was the first project for EECS 494: Introduction to Game Development, a class at the University of Michigan that I took in the fall 2023 semester. My partner (Kaavya Ramachandhran) and I were tasked with recreating the first level of the classic NES game <i>Metroid</i>
                        in the <b>Unity</b> Engine. We also had to design and implement our own brand-new mechanic with a custom level into the game. Both the classic and new levels can be accessed from the main menu. 
                </p>
                <p>
                        I handled implementing all of the enemies, player movement, animations, and power-ups into the game. I also designed and programmed our custom mechanic. Kaavya added the camera tracking, sound effects, enemy and power-up placement, room transitions, 
                        and the level design for our custom level. 
                </p>
                <p>
                        Overall this project was a great way to refamiliarize myself with coding in <b>Unity and C#</b>, and creating the custom level taught me how to naturally introduce and expand upon concepts within a level.
