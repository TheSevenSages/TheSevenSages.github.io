                Welcome to my website! My name is Jacob Robinson, and I'm an aspiring game developer at the University of Michigan. I'm the treasurer for WolverineSoft,
                the premier game development club at UofM. I also work as a game developer and designer at WolverineSoft Studio, which is our student-led game development studio.
                Check out the portfolio section of this website if you'd like to read a bit more about my projects with the studio, or if you'd like to play the games yourself!

                I'm currently working as the head of our design team. This fall we're working on a classic-style RPG, this is a genre that hold a special place in my heart so I'm 
                excited to finally get to work on one! What we have so far is looking pretty good, and I can't wait to share more about the project as soon as I can!

                In the meantime, check out the trailer for my most recent release with WolverineSoft Studio: <i>Cellosseum</i>, a cellular-themed action-roguelike game
                based on Chimeric's <i>Nova Drift</i>. I'm really proud of how this one turned out, it might be our most complete and polished game yet! check it out on Steam if you think it looks interesting:
