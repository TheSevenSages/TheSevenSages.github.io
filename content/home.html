<h1 style="text-align: center;">Welcome!</h1>
<div class="basic_text">
        <p>
                Welcome to my website! My name is Jacob Robinson, and I'm an aspiring game developer at the University of Michigan. I'm the treasurer for WolverineSoft,
                the premier game development club at UofM. I also work as a game developer and designer at WolverineSoft Studio, which is our student-led game development studio.
                Check out the portfolio section of this website if you'd like to read a bit more about my projects with the studio, or if you'd like to play the games yourself! 
        </p>
        <p>
                I'm currently working as the head of our design team for the summer semester! This time we're developing a case-study of <i>Nova Drift</i> by Chimeric,
                so look forward to hearing more about that soon.
        </p>
        <p>
                In the meantime though, check out the trailer for my most recent release with WolverineSoft Studio: <i>Curse of the Corsair</i>, a pirate-themed action-adventure game
                based on Heart Machines <i>Hyper Light Drifter</i>! I'm really proud of how this one turned out, check it out on Steam if you think it looks interesting:
