                <span style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 20px;">Hello, my name is Jacob Robinson!</span> I'm currently a Computer Science major at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.
                I'm also a game designer and programmer at UofM's student-led game development organization: WolverineSoft.
                In addition, I serve as the treasurer for the organization and played a major role in organizing and fundraising for our trip to GDC(Game Developers Conference) in March of 2023.

                Video games have always been a large part of my life, some of my earliest memories involve playing New Super Mario Bros and Poke&#769;mon SoulSilver on my DS.
                I can still remember when I got a Nintendo Wii for my 8th birthday, where I was introduced to classics like Mario Galaxy, Wii Sports, and LEGO Star Wars!
                This love for video games has been a throughline in my life for as long as I can remember, and it continues to be as strong as ever today!

                Even so, I hadn't genuinely considered making games of my own until I was around 18 years old. Stuck in my house during the lockdown in the fall of 2020: the perfect time for me to pick up a new skill!
                And so, inspired by my love of games such as Dreams and Mario Maker, I set out to make my own games using only JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
                I had already been taught the basics of HTML in a website-development class that I had taken in High School a few years prior, but I didn't know a lick of JavaScript. 
                So I followed numerous online tutorials, made my own learning goals and projects, and effectively taught myself the basics of how to code!

                Project after project, my love for coding grew along with my appreciation for game development. This all culminated in my acceptance into the University of Michigan and my decision to major in Computer Science. 
                One of the first things I did after getting my acceptance letter was look for game development opportunities at UofM. That's when I discovered WolverineSoft. 
                I attended one of WolverineSoft's game jams(48-hour game development competitions for those uninitiated) in the fall of my freshman year, and I've been hooked on game development ever since! 
        </p>
        <p>
                Now my goal is to enter the Video Game Industry after college, and employ my passion for games and knowledge of game development to make something truly special!
